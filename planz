goal: 
	chat
	combat

chat:
	talking is default behavior of entering text into console
	/slash commands interpreted as such, etc
	console:
		input at the bottom, display to the right?

combat:
	do on nocollision = false
	compare sets of settable attributes on the userstate
		as a subproperty?
		userState = {bunch of properties: bunch of values, attributes: {more stuff}}
		perhaps so, to make sure that is the only level the user gets to fuck with
	hp and ac at least?
	make it a roguelike
