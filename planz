goal: 
	chat
	combat

chat:
	talking is default behavior of entering text into console
	/slash commands interpreted as such, etc
	console:
		input at the bottom, display to the right?
	console + output should be separate element declared inside 'room'
		'room' will need an attribute and handler to receive and act on input from console

combat:
	do on nocollision = false
	compare sets of settable attributes on the userstate
		as a subproperty?
		userState = {bunch of properties: bunch of values, attributes: {more stuff}}
		perhaps so, to make sure that is the only level the user gets to fuck with
	hp and ac at least?
	make it roguelike
	reproduce standard NH attributes or simplified DF versions
		make their values random
		make them invisible to others, of course

later:
	add support for walls
		single wall entity that detects other walls beside it and displays the appropriate character
		will require supporting code page 437
			this in turn might require (or make sensible) refactoring to use codepoint values for all displayed characters
		LOGO style drawing - user inputs command to raise and lower wall-drawing "pen". command "/turtle"?
