goal: 
	chat DONE
	combat
	refactor to display name where relevant, rather than id DONE
		including "you bump into <name>" on collision DONE
	add list + checker for unique name? PROBABLY NOT
	what happens when two users enter the same space at the same time
	/me + " " returns "user undefined", fix that


chat:
	talking is default behavior of entering text into console DONE
	/slash commands interpreted as such, etc DONE.... I THINK?
		list of needed slash commands:
			/me DONE
			?
	console + output should be separate element declared inside 'room' YA OBVS 
		'room' will need an attribute and handler to receive and act on input from console NOT QUITE, BUT DONE

combat:
	do on nocollision = false
	compare sets of settable attributes on the userstate
		as a subproperty?
		userState = {bunch of properties: bunch of values, attributes: {more stuff}}
		perhaps so, to make sure that is the only level the user gets to fuck with
	hp and ac at least?
	make it roguelike
	reproduce standard NH attributes or simplified DF versions
		make their values random
		make them invisible to others, of course

later:
	add support for walls
		single wall entity that detects other walls beside it and displays the appropriate character
		will require supporting code page 437
			this in turn might require (or make sensible) refactoring to use codepoint values for all displayed characters
		LOGO style drawing - user inputs command to raise and lower wall-drawing "pen". command "/turtle"?
			single lines: permeable/cosmetic
			double lines: collision-positive
			and if we're going that far, why not doors with settable attributes too
				such that a user's attributes object has to contain the correct key to allow passage
		DF-style 'zone/room' designating?
			always centered on character
			not sure what the added value would be however - discursive 'spaces' already modeled with walls/doors
			though actually drawing a space is somewhat more elegant
			
parsing console string for slash command:
if (string.substring(0,1) == "/"){ 
	var fuck = string.substring(1,string.indexOf(" ")); // between the slash and the first space
	if (handlerObj.fuck) {
		handlerObj.fuck(); // POJO like the keyhandlers
	}
}

seriously what the hell

note: evt.target.shadowRoot.activeElement.id 
what a clusterfuck but jaysus it works
